The [HYDAT database](https://www.ec.gc.ca/rhc-wsc/default.asp?lang=En&n=9018B5EC-1) database consists of Microsoft Access .mdb file providing data on daily water flows and levels throughout Canada.\n",

This notebook then reads the ..csv file to extract information relevant to the Rainy River basin and stores the results in this repository's data directory.  Due to size constraints , only the data relevant to the Rainy River Watershed is included in the repository. Neither the HYDAT database or extracted .csv files are included in this repository.\n",
