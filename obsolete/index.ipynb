    "Rainy River discharges an area greater than 50,000 square kilometers, which slightly less than size of West Virginia in the U.S., or greater than the area of Denmark, Switzerland, or Bosnia in Europe. The Rainy River Basin is part of the Canadian Shield, which is the largest freshwater surface are in the world. 25% of the world's wetlands are in Canada, and 7% of the world's renewable water supply.\n",

    "The following notebooks provide tools to access relevant level, flow, and precipitation data for an analysis of the hydrology of Rainy Lake. These notebooks 'pickle' relevant data series as Pandas series and dataframes for import into other notebooks.\n",

    "Notebook | Description \n",
    "-------- | -----------\n",
    "[Water Survey of Canada](notebooks/Water_Survey_of_Canada.ipynb) | Reads the HYDAT data tables stored in CSV format.  Pickles pandas dataframes WSC_STATIONS, WSC_LEVELS, and WSC_FLOWS in the data directory. Creates a local HDF cache `data/hydat.h5` of the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Water Survey of Canada](notebooks/Water_Survey_of_Canada.ipynb). Reads data from the HYDAT data tables stored in CSV format. Creates a local HDF cache `data/hydat.h5` in the local repository for a given set of flow and level stations. Also pickles Pandas dataframes for station, level, and flow to the respository data directory.\n",
    "* [Namakan Lake Water Levels](notebooks/Namakan_Lake_Water_Levels.ipynb). Reads the WSC data cache to create a time series `data/NL.pkl` of historical levels for Namakan Lake. Level data from stations located at Namakan Lake above Kettle Falls and at Squirrel Island and are concatenated, with means used for overlapping dates.\n",
    "* [Rainy Lake Water Levels](notebooks/Rainy_Lake_Water_Levels.ipynb). Reads the WSC data cache to create a reconciled time series `data/RL.pkl` of historical levels for Rainy Lake.  The difference in reconciled measurements at Bear's Pass and Fort Frances is used to estimate a standard error for lake level measurement.\n",
    "* [Rainy River Flows](notebooks/Rainy_River_Flows.ipynb). Reads the WSC data cache to create a time series `data/RR.pkl` of historical flows for Rainy River.  \n",
    "* [Stage-Volume Relationships for Rainy and Namakan Lakes](notebooks/Stage-Volume_Relationships.ipynb). Regression of Stage-Volume data from the International Joint Commission for Rainy and Namakan Lakes to produce functions to estimate changes in lake volume.\n",
    "* [Rule Curves for Rainy and Namakan Lakes](notebooks/Rule_Curves_for_Rainy_and_Namakan_Lakes.ipynb). Create a time series representation of rule curves for Rainy and Namakan Lakes.\n",
    "* [Global Historical Climatology Network](notebooks/Global_Historical_Climatology_Network.ipynb). Reads historical temperature and preciptation records for station KINL located at International Falls, Minnesota.\n",
